OLS members who have participated as a project lead in a previous cohort or have joined as an expert can volunteer to take the video facilitator role in the ongoing cohort. These individuals would like to learn more about the OLS processes or take a vital role in leading/facilitating the cohort calls. They commit their time and leadership skills toward building a collaborative experience for the attendees of OLS cohort calls.

We are very excited to create this role in OLS for the returning members from the previous cohorts. 

Our aim is to share our practices for training and planning so you can take them into your projects and community. This is also an opportunity for us to invite community members to take on some of the management roles.

## üíÅ Responsibilities

**Video facilitators are responsible for the post-call tasks.**

What you need before starting: 

- [ ] Please ask the organising team access to:
  - [ ] [Otter.ai](http://otter.ai/).
  - [ ] OLS YouTube channel. Create a YouTube account with your personal email, and ask the cohort coordinator to give you editor access to the OLS YouTube account.
- [ ] Link to Zoom recordings.
- [ ] [Slide template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lDLg0xztRfyEgdlJWFDHJMRW6c6k1Yyh02vux8HKDQA/edit#slide=id.g2127687abdb_2_2) for the video thumbnail. 
- [ ] Link to the cohort planning sheet.


#### Please try doing the video processing on the same week of the cohort call, so we can add the link to the recording to the weekly cohort mailing we send every Monday to all cohort members.

_Time commitment: 120-150 minutes per call_

Below we provide a summary checklist. For a detailed tutorial, please refer to [the detailed tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c92qDtKLvEM3stKWh0z0uIsqyyLWG37nnsgekbsiiKE/edit#heading=h.hfhzrjvnj7qh).

- [ ] 1. Download the video from Zoom cloud recordings.
- [ ] 2. Upload the video to Otter.ai (_will need a few minutes to process_).
- [ ] 3. Upload video to the OLS YouTube account.
- [ ] 4. Create a thumbnail for the video with the cohort call details using the template.
- [ ] 5. Make sure the YouTube video is added to the current cohort playlist.
- [ ] 6. Correct Otter.ai transcripts (_make sure to use the uploaded video, not the original transcript, as the timings won't match the video_)
- [ ] 7. Download the corrected transcript as a .srt file from Otter.
- [ ] 8. Upload it to the YouTube video.
- [ ] 9. Post a link to the recording in the OLS Slack! 

#### After publishing the video, fill in the following information in the cohort planning sheet:

- [ ] Add the link of YouTube video (column "Recording")
- [ ] In the same column, add the corresponding YouTube link at the exact time each individual talk starts: on YouTube, click "Share", tick "Start at" so that the starting time of each talk shows up, then click "Copy" and paste the link in the spreadsheet.

After you've completed these tasks, please fill out the [honorarium form](https://openlifescience.civicrm.org/civicrm/honorarium).
