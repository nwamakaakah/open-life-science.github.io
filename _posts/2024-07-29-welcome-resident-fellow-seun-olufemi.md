## A Biochemistry Researcher and Champion of Open Practices
Seun na Biochemistry graduate from [Ladoke Akintola University of Technology](https://www.lautech.edu.ng/). Im dey passionate about how disease dey start for di body (molecular pathogenesis) and how to develop drugs to stop am.
Im also be strong champion for digital skills and open science.
Im dey work as Graduate Research Intern for [Institute of Human Virology](https://ihvnigeria.org/), Nigeria, wia im dey study how disease dey spread for di body at the molecular level.
E also be Research and Teaching Assistant for [Helix Biogen Institute](https://www.helixbiogeninstitute.org/), wia e dey support research wey dey take scientific findings and turn am to something wey people fit use (translational research) and training for bioinformatics and vaccine design.
Even though Seun still dey early for im career as researcher, im don already publish eight peer-reviewed articles.

## Seun Dey Wear Many Hats for Open Science
As e dey committed to improve bioinformatics and open science skills for Early Career Researchers for him community, Seun dey contribute to many initiatives. As person wey benefit from OLS Open Seeds before (Cohort 7), im co-found [Bioinformatics Outreach Nigeria](https://github.com/seunolufemi123/Bioinformatics-Outreach-Nigeria) project to solve di problem of no training for bioinformatics for Nigeria and to mobilize many young scientists wey go embrace in open science.

E recently don become [PREreview champion](https://prereview.org/) and [ASAPbio fellow](https://asapbio.org/) (2024) wey dey try make sure everybody get access to knowledge from research wey dem never publish yet.
E also serve as hub champion for di Catalyst program for him region and go support him network to engage with di OLS-9 Catalyst Track wey Taj dey lead.

## Resident Fellowship to Build Community Leadership Capacity
Seun work for OLS go focus on how to manage and lead a community as im continue to lead and grow di Bioinformatics Outreach Nigeria Project with people for im community. Malvika go mentor am and im go connect with di whole OLS team, wey go give am chance to learn about all di different things wey di organization dey do.

**Im Resident Fellowship go cover two parts for OLS:**

1. Because im dey part of di OLS-9 Delivery team, im go get experience on how dem dey organize training for whole communities. Im go work with Malvika to coordinate di OLS-9 DRI-EDIA Track.
2. E go get special one-on-one training and support to build skills and knowledge wey go help am spread di skills of bioinformatics and open science to im local communities. Specifically, dem go support am to change di Open Seeds training materials to fit im community and connect am with di whole network of open science people.

**Join us as we welcome Seun!**
